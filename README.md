# apache-kafka-node

I was recently thinking about the applications of web sockets in a real-time application to collect and report on heart attacks monitored through wearable tech such as Fitbit. 
- I had heard of Apache Kafka but did not know of its application so I've spent the past week digging into it and I'm happy to report on its uses. I'm actually excited to see how I can utilize this technology in other apps because I'm salivating at the thought of what I could build with this tech I just learnt. 

Below are its uses/applications that chatGPT provided:

1. Finance: Apache Kafka is used to manage real-time transaction data, to perform fraud detection, to monitor compliance, and to generate risk reports.

2. Retail: Retail companies use Apache Kafka to manage inventory data, to track customer behavior, to provide personalized recommendations, and to optimize supply chain operations.

3. Healthcare: Apache Kafka is used to collect and analyze data from medical devices, to monitor patient data in real-time, and to perform data analysis for research purposes.

4. Telecommunications: Telecom companies use Apache Kafka to manage call logs, to perform real-time network monitoring, and to manage customer data for billing and customer support.

5. Transportation: Apache Kafka is used to manage real-time traffic data, to provide real-time tracking of vehicles, and to optimize logistics and supply chain operations.

6. Gaming: Gaming companies use Apache Kafka to manage real-time game data, to provide personalized game experiences, and to manage player data and feedback.

Overall, Apache Kafka is a powerful platform for managing real-time data streams and can be applied to a wide range of industries and use cases.

I wonder if I could make a video streamer out of this. 

Where, a live video feed is broken into chunks and streamed real-time to the consumer. That's a thought. I'd be happy to find that out.
